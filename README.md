# Personality-Prediction-Model

This is my first Machine Learning project💃🏻. 
It deals with creating a Machine Learning algorithm that analyses a person’s personality according to what he or she posts on social media according to Myers Briggs Personality Test.
It analyses the data provided and prints a graph for the number of words per comment by the user and gives the accuracy of the various ML algorithms on different columns created in the dataset.
It also prints word clouds according to each Personality Type.

Hope you like my project!
